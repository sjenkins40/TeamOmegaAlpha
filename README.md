Heart Attack is a 3D platformer, to move the character around, use the arrow keys or wasd.
Use the mouse to move the camera, press spacebar to jump, and press the shift key to dash
punch. If you want to pause or unpause the game, use the escape key. Finally, to complete a
stage, you must reach the orange box at the end of the level.

It satifies all the requirements for the project, it was built in Unity, and it is entirely a
3D world. The character the player plays has interesting and different animations and moves 
depending on what the player presses. The character is entirely custom, and made in Maya using
key frames and inverse kinematics. We imported these models, and blended the animations together.

The game has good Game Feel. We made sure the controls were responsive, snappy, and flow together.
This combined with the sound effects the player's movement has, makes the act of just getting around
in these levels very entertaining. With the amount of movement options we gave the players, we made
sure our levels could accomodate for them, and put the player's movement skills to the limit. 

Our game has good UI, with clear start, end, and pause screens, as well as a health UI. All our menus
are extremely apparent what they do, and are very intuitive in general.

Going through the game, you'll notice the enemies we created have dynamic AI using a state machine. The first enemy you
encounter is set to navigate a certain path, but will attack and follow you if you get within range of it.
When this occurs, their eye will go from green to red to indicate they are attacking you. A slightly different
enemy can be encountered a bit later, two areas away with a gun. This enemy will shoot consistently, but
only if the player is in range, and it will aim at the player as well. Of course these enemies can all be
defeated using a dash punch, and the dash punch will also have a bit of knockback and a sound effect to give
the player feedback. When a player defeats an enemy, the player's dashpunch and double jump get reset, allowing the
player to continue their aerial movement.
